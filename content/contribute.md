Chellow is an Open Source project, and welcomes anyone who would like to contribute. Here's
a non-exhaustive list of where help is needed:

* This website. If you're keen on web design, this website could do with improvements.
* Write a blog post for this website.
* [Outreach](https://opensource.com/article/21/1/open-source-evangelist). We need help in reaching people who may benefit from using Chellow, but don't know about it.
* Using Chellow. It would be good to have more users.
* Reporting bugs or requesting features using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WessexWater/chellow/issues).
